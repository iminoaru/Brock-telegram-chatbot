Appearance
Brock's most notable feature is that his eyes appear to be closed all the time. The rare times he fully opens his eyes are when they are forced to open unnaturally; examples include when he was hit by Charmander's Flamethrower in The Ninja Poké-Showdown, when he was hit in the back of the head by Arbok's tail in Who Gets to Keep Togepi?, and when he made a face for Larvitar in A Crowning Achievement. This has been the center of fan attention for a long time. He also has spiky dark Kournikova hair and tan skin, notably darker than the skin of any other major character in the anime (until Iris in the Best Wishes series).

Along with Tracey, Cilan and Kiawe, Brock is the tallest of Ash's traveling companions and the closest to looking like an adult. Next to actual adult characters, however, it is clear that he is still a teenager. Not counting temporary outfits, he has worn three different outfits, all of which have had the colors orange, green and brown with blue shoes.

The Beginning
In Pokémon the Series: The Beginning, he wore an orange t-shirt, a lime green cargo vest with four pockets, a dark brown belt with a gold buckle and dark red pockets, brown jeans and blue-gray sneakers with white trim.

His original outfit is also seen during flashbacks throughout the anime series' run.

Ruby and Sapphire
In Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire, he appeared in a new outfit, which consisted of a brown short-sleeved jacket with orange trim, a green short-sleeved undershirt, grayish-brown cargo pants, and indigo sneakers with light blue trim.

Diamond and Pearl
In Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl, he wears yet another new outfit, consisting of a green collared shirt, an orange vest with brown trim, khaki pants with knee stitching, and blue high-top sneakers.

 

Sun & Moon
In Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon, Brock wears his old outfit in the Original series has minor changes. His lime green cargo vest lacks the two pockets in the edge of both sides. During the Gym battle against Kiawe as he mega evolves his Steelix into Mega Steelix, Brock removes his shirt and vest making him resemble his counterpart in Pokémon Red and Blue and wears a necklace with a Key Stone embedded as a pendant.

This appearance was seen again in Pokémon Journeys: The Series, where Brock takes off his collared shirt and vest from his old outfit in Diamond and Pearl but he is not seen wearing his Key Stone necklace.

During his and Misty's visit in Alola, he wears a cloudy blue sky and plain landform-theme buttoned shirt, beige short pants and blue shoes.

His old outfit is seen again in Aim to Be a Pokémon Master.

Journeys
In Pokémon Journeys: The Series, Brock initially wears a resident uniform worn by resident doctors consists of a white lab coat over his shades of blue scrubs and his blue-gray sneakers with white trim from his old outfit in the Original series. This is due to his occupation as a Pokémon Doctor. He later wore this when he watched the final battle between Ash and Leon in the World Coronation series along with his Croagunk and his Blissey and both Alexa and Cilan and his Pansage.

When he travels with Ash, Goh and Dawn, he wears his old outfit in Diamond and Pearl and he has a brown belt around his waist being concealed on his green collared shirt which he reveals it when he took off both of his collared shirt and vest.

Personality
Brock is considered the most mature, wise and levelheaded of the main characters and he is arguably the most intelligent character as well. He often acts as an older brother and caretaker to the other characters and a voice of reason in disputes. He will usually place others before himself and will help and support his friends even against his better judgment or at his own expense. While he does not battle often, he can understand situations and strategies in any Pokémon battle, and often explains them to the other characters, probably because he was once a Gym Leader. His wisdom is possibly derived from how observant he is; he can tell just by sight how a Pokémon is feeling.

Brock always carries books and maps with him and thus, is usually the character who knows where the group is headed and what they can do when they get there, though in the Advanced Generation series this role was mostly taken over by Max, who owns a PokéNav. He also carries a lot of other supplies, such as Potions, Pokémon food and a set of cookware, as well as practical tools like a brush and pocket knife; in The School of Hard Knocks, the extent of his preparedness and comically large capacity of his bag was demonstrated, as he pulled a table and full tea set out of his backpack. He is a domestic and grooms not only his Pokémon but also those of his friends with whom he travels. He handles all the cooking and cleaning for his friends.

Despite this, all his maturity and rationality leaves him completely when he catches sight of a beautiful woman. Brock has a desperate need for female companionship, which grows worse as he fails to gain it. He will do anything and everything he thinks will impress women, which inevitably ends with his heart being broken every time. A few women have shown interest in him though, such as Wilhelmina, Temacu, Natalie, Lucy, Holly, Autumn, Narissa and Lizabeth, but most others do not notice him or are not interested.

No matter how many times he is disappointed, though, Brock remains determined to find a girl to start a relationship with and has indicated several times he would stop traveling with Ash and stay with the girl if this happened. He also likes both Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. This behavior tends to wear on the nerves of his friends or others around him, especially Misty and Max who both commonly dragged Brock away from women by his ear. Some of Brock's own Pokémon, most notably Croagunk, have attacked him for getting too flirtatious with women and dragged him off as well as punishment for his behavior.

His goals have played a passive role in his character's activity and development, and his role has generally been one of support for other main characters, usually contributing more in terms of wisdom and comedic antics than the action of the series. Unlike other characters, who aspire to achieve and excel in competitive fields like Pokémon training and Pokémon Contests, his aim to become a great Pokémon Breeder is a quiet one and thus is not showcased frequently. This caused him to question if he was actually pursuing his dreams like his friends were near the end of the Diamond & Pearl series and ultimately lead to him deciding to become a Pokémon Doctor instead. His other goal, to find a girlfriend, is similar to Team Rocket's quest to capture Pikachu, in which both are for comedy and thus doomed to fail.

Brock is very caring towards his siblings including his younger brother, Forrest and has great respect for his father, Flint. In A Family that Battles Together Stays Together! and Grating Spaces! He also shows his anger and disdain towards his mother, Lola who is responsible for remodeling the Pewter Gym into an aquatic gym, as well as her ditzy behavior.

 

Etymology
The name Brock originates from the word "rock".

His Japanese name, Takeshi, originates from 岳 (take, mountain peak) and 石 (ishi, stone). With the plant-themed naming of most Gym Leaders, it may also include 竹 (take, bamboo).

Biography
Incomplete!
When Ash arrives in Pewter City, following getting his Pokémon healed at the Pokémon Center by Nurse Joy, he travels to the Pewter City Gym to face Brock for his Boulder Badge. However, due to Brock specializing in Rock-type Pokémon, Pikachu is no match for Onix, and Ash is forced to surrender the match. After Ash loses to Brock, a stranger offers to help make his Pikachu stronger. Pikachu (after being hooked up to a local hydro-power station) becomes stronger and manages to defeat Geodude, but Onix remains too strong. Onix has Pikachu in a body bind; however, Pikachu's previous electric attack ravaged the gym, which set off the fire sprinklers, weakening Onix. Though Pikachu is able to then damage Onix further, before Ash can deal the finishing blow, he is restrained by Brock's younger siblings, demanding he leaves Onix alone, before Brock orders them to stand down. Though Ash technically won, he declines the badge on the grounds that he unfairly beat Brock, but Brock later catches up to him and presents him with the Boulder Badge anyway, saying that he wants Ash to fulfill his dream of becoming the best. The stranger that first helped Ash reveals himself to be Brock's father, Flint.

After entrusting Flint with taking care of the gym and the rest of his siblings, Brock is now free to train himself and joins Ash and Misty on their journey. Since then, he travels with Ash and Misty on his many adventures. In the Orange Islands series, he leaves the team to join Professor Felina Ivy but mysteriously returns to Pallet Town when Ash wins the Orange League Championship. When asked what happened, Brock just rolled up into a ball and replied, "I don't wanna talk about it" or "Don't mention that name". This would happen every time someone mentioned Professor Ivy. Rejoining Ash and Misty, Brock travels to Johto, where he continues to help Ash and Misty. Upon the conclusion of the Silver Conference, the three part ways, with Brock heading back to Pewter City. It is there (in an episode of Pokémon Chronicles) that he discovers his estranged mother Lola (Mizuho in the original), who, because she is a Water-type Pokémon Trainer, has ruined the reputation of the Gym he defended so long ago and had ended up filling the gym with water (causing Brock to comically freak out and keep repeating "A LAKE!!!" when he first sees it).

By defeating his mother, he restores the Gym's reputation and proceeds to leave all his Pokémon (except Forretress) to his younger brother Forrest, before departing for the Hoenn region, where he catches up with Ash and his two new friends, May and Max.

The group travels across Hoenn and then return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier. The group went their separate ways and Brock met up with Ash in Sinnoh. While there, they meet a new coordinator named Dawn and her partner Piplup, who joins them on their journey through Sinnoh.

During this time, both Brock's father, Flint (Munō in the original, who was also Brock's predecessor as Gym Leader), ran off again, and his oldest younger brother Forrest (Jirō in the original) took the role of Gym Leader in Pewter City, as well as the responsibility of caring for his many other younger siblings. Brock is the oldest of ten siblings, with five brothers and four sisters.

Brock is always well-equipped and is sometimes the voice of reason when Ash and Misty (and later, May and Dawn) get into an argument. He is also hardworking and is always willing to help others. Coupled with his experiences in taking care of others, Brock often prepares food and does most of the chores for the main characters. Brock is also exceptionally good at making food for Pokémon.

At the end of the Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl series, Brock aspires to become a Pokémon Doctor, and work alongside Nurse Joy. After departing from Ash and Dawn, Brock returns home to Pewter City to train to become a Pokémon Doctor.

In the Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl Special Episode 2, he's revealed to have photos of Ash, Misty, May, Max, Dawn, Piplup, and Pikachu to remind him of how much fun it was traveling with them. He also chooses his brother Forrest to replace him as Gym Leader so he can study to become a Pokémon Doctor.

In the Best Wishes episode Expedition to Onix Island!, Brock was mentioned by Dawn during their lunch break at the beach as Cilan wants to know who he is. Ash finally tells Cilan and Iris about Brock as his previous traveling companion and he currently studies as a Pokémon Doctor.

Brock was last seen along with Misty, May, Max and Dawn in The Dream Continues! when Ash remembers his friends throughout his journey before falling asleep for his next journey in the Kalos region.

In the Black and White Special, he encounters Cilan in a small town. He helps treat Pansage after it got hurt fighting a Gyarados. The two form a fast friendship and work together as they help Gyarados. As they part ways, they both realize they never asked for each other's names.

In the Sun & Moon series, Brock returns alongside Misty when Ash returns to Kanto along with his new Alolan friends. Brock also travels to the Alola region as one of the special guests for their special curriculum class. Brock first introduced himself to Lillie as a Pokémon doctor-in-training while checking up Lillie's Alolan Vulpix who is discomfort from motion sickness. Upon his reunion with Ash, Brock flirts with a flight cabin attendant only to be pinched in the ear by Misty who scolds him that they came here to see Ash not to act like an idiot. Both he and Misty finally introduced themselves to Kiawe, Mallow, Sophocles, Lana, and Lillie. Both guide them within Professor Oak's laboratory and also release some Pokémon including his Geodude along with the Alolan ones who were released by Misty. Brock also restrains the Marowak he releases due to the strong rivalry towards Kiawe's Alolan Marowak but their rivalry never came to a halt. As everyone splits up to find Kiawe's Marowak and Lana's Popplio, Ash recalls their previous journeys in Kanto and Johto regions until his reunion with his Bulbasaur. After finding both of their Pokémon, they were caught by ta Meowth robot manned by Team Rocket. Brock and Misty release both Crobat and Staryu to aid Ash's Lycanroc to fight the robot as he let his Crobat unleashes its powerful Supersonic to counter Meowth's control allowing both Lycanroc and Staryu to destroy the robot with Accelerock and Bubble Beam before Bewear catches them in flight. He was with the others who were put to sleep by Jigglypuff's Sing who emerges from the destroyed Meowth robot.

After the incident, they are seen eating at sunset during their welcoming party until the next day they bid farewell to both Delia and Professor Oak to depart to Cerulean City by bus. When Misty reveals that her three sisters were absent at the Cerulean City Gym due to their travels, Brock becomes depressed as everyone gives him a hearty laugh.

Brock later battles both Sophocles and Lillie in a handicap by using his Geodude at the newly rebuilt Cerulean City Gym. Brock also tells Sophocles that electric attacks won't work on the ground type when he mistakes his Geodude being an Alolan type. When Lillie's Alolan Vulpix unleashes its Powder Snow, Brock let Geodude unleashes its newly learned Gyro Ball to disperse the attack, surprising them both.

Later on, Brock battles against Kiawe who releases his Turtonator in a Gym battle as he releases his Steelix. Ash was surprised to see Brock is even stronger than before as he cheers him and Kiawe on in the battlefield. His Steelix manages to withstand Turtonator's Flamethrower and counters by using it's newly learned Gyro Ball followed by both Bind and Dig. Brock taunts Kiawe for being desperate to win as he was knowledgeable about the Z-Moves and wants to show his full strength. He later removes his vest and shirt to reveal his necklace with a Key Stone embedded as a pendant as he rips it to mega evolve his Steelix into Mega Steelix much to Kiawe's shock. Despite his efforts to beat his Mega Steelix with Turtonator's Inferno Overdrive, Brock confidently let his Steelix to use his Stone Edge to defeat it immediately. Brock later serves as a referee in the battle against Ash and Misty. When Ash and his friends are about to return to Alola, Brock gives Sophocles and Kiawe Boulder Badges despite the latter's loss in their Gym battle. But before they depart back to the Alola region, Ash tells him and Misty to visit him sometime at Alola which they agreed.

Brock and Misty return to visit Ash and his friends in Alola after their classes in Pokémon School. When visiting the Pokémon Center, he became lovestruck on Nurse Joy only to be pinched in the ear by Misty. Brock then decides to stay at the Pokémon Center to help Nurse Joy. It was revealed that working at the Pokémon Center was harder than he thinks. Because of his assistance, Nurse Joy gives him a Comfey as a token of gratitude. After Ash and the others defeat Team Rocket, Brock sets up a tent outside on Professor Kukui's house to wait for Ash and Misty and he prepares a stew for dinner. As they arrived to see him, Misty's Psyduck pops out of her Poké Ball to eat their dinner much to Misty's annoyance.

The next day everyone compliments Brock's cooking before visiting Kiawe's farm in Akala Island. When a wild Kangaskhan is defending its child due to its injuries, Brock decided to tame it by releasing his Comfey given to him by Nurse Joy to soothes them with its move. Despite being scratched by a Kangaskhan, Brock manages to tame it so that its child be treated its injuries. Upon Olivia visits Ash and the others, Brock became lovestruck towards her as Olivia begins to have feelings towards Brock. He and Olivia battle one-on-one between her Lycanroc and his Sudowoodo. Their fight was interrupted by Team Rocket who captures Ash and the group including their Pokémon. He and Olivia teamed up to fight the gigantic Team Rocket's Meowth robot by letting Lycanroc and Sudowoodo to hit it with Rock Slide and Low Kick combination. Brock then joins up with Olivia to unleashed the Z-Move Continental Crush in a heart shape to smash the robot in an explosion before Bewear and Stufful took Team Rocket away and rescues Ash and the group including their Pokémon. Afterward, they watched the fireworks display before he and Misty decided to return to Kanto.

In Pokémon Journeys: The Series during the special episodes of Arceus, the One Called God, Brock was now seen as a Pokémon Doctor, finally fulfilling his dreams and he was working at the Pokémon Center in Sinnoh while being helped by his Croagunk and his Chansey who was now evolved into Blissey. He reunites with Ash and Dawn and befriended Ash's new companion Goh. He helps them to rescue Heatran who was captured by Team Galactic led by Saturn who continued the criminal operations following their recent arrests and disbandment as well as Cyrus' recent disappearance. Brock encounters his Toxicroak, which led his Croagunk to immediately released on its own to battle it's rival, finally reigniting it's heated rivalry. Brock later sent both his Steelix and Blissey to fend off Mars' Purugly while being aided with Cynthia's Roserade and her Garchomp. Brock later used his Steelix to use Dig to make Ash and the group to find Heatran. Despite taking off his collared vest and shirt, he was not seen wearing his Key Stone necklace and was unable to Mega evolved his Steelix, he still uses his Steelix to assists Cynthia's Garchomp to continue digging underground. Brock later encountered Heatran once again who is now in a berserk state along with Ash, Dawn, Goh and their Pokémon including Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit and seeing his two friends rescuing Dawn from falling and they moved into a higher ground. Arceus appears and manages to take down the helicopter piloted by Team Galactic led by Saturn using Judgment to make Roserade bound themselves with its Power Whip.

Running Gags
Over the course of the series, there have come to be a couple of recurring gags related to Brock that has become quite prominent.

Girls
One of the most notable running gags in the anime is that Brock makes advances towards every girl his age or older, and is usually met by rejection, confusion, or being dragged away from them by Misty, Max, or his Pokémon, Croagunk. One of the several exceptions was Professor Ivy, the Pokémon Professor from the Orange Islands, with whom he spent some time away from the show. He later returns but refuses to explain why he left her, simply saying "Don't mention that name!" Pike Queen Lucy of the Battle Frontier in Tohjo Falls seems to have a liking towards Brock (partially because she has a soft spot for Pokémon with squinty eyes) almost traveling with him before Max interrupts. Other girls who had feelings for Brock include Wilhomena, Temacu, Natalie, Autumn, Narissa, Lizabeth, and Holly. In the Sun & Moon series, the Kahuna Olivia also has feelings for Brock.

His crushes include the various Nurse Joys and Officer Jennys, which he can differentiate with ease based on very perceptive but minute observations. Because of this, he can spot imposter Joys and Jennys instantly. Other crushes are Rhonda and Rhoda.

 

Oatmeal Pokémon
Another one of the notable running gags is how Brock is forced to entertain an audience while other characters retrieve something which would typically be another Pokémon that would have been putting on a show for the current audience that has likely been stolen by Team Rocket. During the cases in which he does, such as he repeats one song (usually an English version of "Takeshi no Paradise", one of the Japanese ending themes) ad nauseam to the point that he is either booed offstage or loses interest in singing. He once revealed that the reason why he sings that song over and over is that it's the only song he knows. After Ash finished the Sinnoh league, Ash and Brock returned to Kanto and went their separate ways. In the Pokémon DP Special Episode 2, Brock is shown studying to become a Pokémon Doctor, and even has photos of Ash, Pikachu, Misty, May, Max, Dawn, and Piplup, reminding himself of how much he misses all of them.

Brock has only met his recently evolved Steelix. Evolving while under the control of his brother Forrest, it remains loyal to Brock and follows his commands at will. It has gained strength after the evolution and remains to be an amazing Pokémon at the Pewter Gym for Brock to call upon whenever he needs it. Brock's Steelix debuted in Showdown In Pewter City as an Onix and in Grating Spaces as a Steelix. During the Gym battle between Paul and Roark, Brock also mentions his own Onix who is now evolved into a Steelix after seeing Roark also owns an Onix.

Brock's eyes.

Brock eyes open
Brock's eyes opened.

Keep em closed
Brock is known for being the very first Gym Leader that Ash faces.
Brock's personality reflects Uxie's one; the Knowledge Pokémon.
Page 322 of "John Willis' Screen World" published in 2003 by Applause Books, says "Eric Stuart (Brock Harrison/James Morgan of Team Rocket)" supports Brock's surname being Harrison.
In a July 2006 interview with K-Zone Australia, Stuart purportedly said "Brock's last name is Harrison."
In the Pokémon DP Special, Brock has photos of Ash, Misty, May, Max, Dawn, Pikachu, and Piplup to remind him of his past journeys through Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Kanto's Battle Frontier and Sinnoh.
Brock is a very talented cook, especially when it comes to making food for Pokémon (this is related to the fact he is a Pokémon Breeder).
In the episodes "The Ninja Poké-Showdown", "Who Gets To Keep Togepi?", and "A Crowning Achievement", Brock actually temporarily has his eyes opened.
Brock has appeared in every series except Best Wishes and XY, not counting flashbacks with Dawn and Ash.
As seen in the episode "The Tower of Terror" and "Taming of the Shroomish", Brock is apparently afraid of ghosts. While he and May were shopping, she heard of a haunted mansion. He was terrified just hearing about it, and, while May was overjoyed, she literally had to drag him there. Whenever he heard somebody talking about ghosts, he leaned away. He was afraid of the mansion and showed dismay and horror when they talked about advancing inside. He was fine once he found out that the ghosts were actually Shroomish, though. He was also fine on Ghoul Daze!, among other episodes.
Brock's real dream is to become a Pokémon doctor. However, in "Jirachi: Wish Maker", he said he wanted to become a magician because he could make "beautiful girls appear out of thin air".
He can notice the small things that make each Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny physically different.
It is said that Brock was taken out and replaced with Tracey due to the notion that he would be racially insensitive to Pokémon's growing worldwide audience. When it was revealed that said notion wasn't the case at all, they put him back in for Johto.
Brock is currently the only traveling companion, other than Ash, to travel with two main female traveling companions who are the playable character in the main game, with the exception of Serena in X and Y.
In the anime, Brock owns both Geodude and Onix during Gym battles. The other one is Roark.

Despite not appearing in the Black and White series, Brock was mentioned several times by Ash and Dawn during Dawn's time in Unova.
While it is never mentioned in the anime, the July 2006 issue of K-Zone Magazine revealed Brock's surname is Harrison.
The reason why Brock temporarily left Ash and Misty (probably during the Orange Islands arc) according to former anime head writer Takeshi Shudo, was due to the upper management deeming that Brock's eyes are too narrow that will make people associate with Asians, whom the management believed that they are folks that Westerners cannot connect with. However, the management eventually decided to bring back Brock for some more seasons after realizing his popularity.
In the anime, he referred to Onigiri as "Jelly-filled Donuts".
He shares the same running gag as the One Piece (Another Japanese Anime) character Sanji, who is very intrested in girls and tries to impress them, but fails every time.
